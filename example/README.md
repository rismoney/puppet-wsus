this is a port to demonstrate a reference implementation of the WSUS module.

additional notes:
In this port I leverage a host impersonation pattern as described here:
https://github.com/jumanjiman/puppetcamp_nyc_2013/blob/master/patterns.md#host-impersonation-pattern

if you do not wish to use that, you can simply modify the referenced facter facts to native ones.
These are all prefixed with ise_mock

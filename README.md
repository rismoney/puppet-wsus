What is WSUS?
Windows Server Update Services (WSUS) enables information technology administrators to deploy the latest Microsoft product updates to computers that are running the Windows operating system. By using WSUS, administrators can fully manage the distribution of updates that are released through Microsoft Update to computers in their network.

What is Puppet?
Puppet is IT automation software that helps system administrators manage infrastructure throughout its lifecycle, from provisioning and configuration to patch management and compliance. Using Puppet, you can easily automate repetitive tasks, quickly deploy critical applications, and proactively manage change, scaling from 10s of servers to 1000s, on-premise or in the cloud.

What is puppet-wsus?
It is a tool to manage WSUS with Puppet.

According to [sans] (http://www.sans.org/reading_room/whitepapers/bestprac/practical-methodology-implementing-patch-management-process_1206) 
an organization should have in place a strategy for establishing, documenting, maintaining and changing the
configuration of all servers and workstations according to their function.
